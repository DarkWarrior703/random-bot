# Random bot

It's just a stupid Discord bot written in Go. It has a lot of commands, but, to be honest, most of them are bad implemented. 

It started as a weeb bot, but evolved into something more. If someone finds a use of this code, you can use it without any copyright.

This bot makes use of a lot of public APIs, and I want to thank to the owners. Also, special thanks to [bwmarrin](github.com/bwmarrin) for _discord-go_ module and also for his _dgvoice_ module, as I copied the file inside the repo to make some changes to the code.
